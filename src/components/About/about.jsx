                    I started to be exposed to Information Technology from a year 2014.
                     On that year thatâ€™s where I started to learn my first Programing
                     language, which was Scratch. The following year I was introduced 
                     to Delphi programing language till I completed my Grade 12. After 
                     my Matric I dived Deeper in IT and went to Start and Complete my 
                     Advanced Diploma in Information Communication Technology. I regard 
                     ICT to be an all in 1 course because in that 4-year period. I learned 
                     lot of things. The focus was not only on the Development side but I 
                     managed to get knowledge about Project Management, Business Analysis, 
                     Data Analysis, Professional Communication, Networking, and Information 
                     System.
